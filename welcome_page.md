## Microbial Hazards Identification Decision Support System  
## (MiID DSS)

This tool is developed to identify microbial hazards (MHs) in
food products for infants and young children <3 years via 
a systematic MHs analysis decision support system (DSS). It is published together with peer review paper:

> A Web-Based Microbiological Hazard Identification Tool for Infant Foods https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2024.113940

The MiID DSS employs 5 major steps that can be accessed
from the left panel which include:  

1. Microbial hazards identification based on food selection and relevant hazard-food pairing 
2. Microbial hazards identification based on processing inactivation 
3. Microbial hazards identification based on hazard recontamination possibility after processing
4. Microbial hazards identification based on food product characteristics and growth opportunity of hazards in selected foods 
5. Microbial hazards identification based on association level to the selected foods.

Background data in detail for each step can be downloaded in text files using the download button, and is available on the supplementary files of the paper.

For additional details and the rationale behind each step, refer to the user manual on the left panel.
